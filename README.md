# Flask Boilerplate (w/ React and Gulp)

A simple boilerplate of a Flask app using Reactjs and Gulp.

Super basic at the moment. Need to update gulp file to handle multiple components. As is, only transforms main.jsx -> main.js


#### Quick Instructions
bower install
npm install
python pip install -r requirements.txt

In top level folder run: gulp
python project/app.py
